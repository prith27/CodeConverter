# Python to C++ Code Conversion Tool üêç‚û°Ô∏è‚ûï‚ûï

This project is a **Gradio-based application** designed to:
1. Convert Python code to C++ code.
2. Execute the provided Python and C++ code.
3. Display the results or errors from execution.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This app was created as a mini project for learning and experimentation purposes. It is **not intended for deployment** in environments where code execution could pose security risks.

---

## Features
- **Code Conversion:** Convert Python code to equivalent C++ code.
- **Execution & Results:** Run the code directly from the interface and view outputs or error messages.
- **Interactive UI:** Simple and user-friendly Gradio interface accessible via the browser.

---

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or copy the code into a Jupyter notebook.
2. Ensure you have the following installed:
   - Python 3.8+
   - Gradio library (`pip install gradio`)
   - Clang++ compiler (for executing C++ code)
3. Launch the notebook and run the app code.
4. The Gradio app will open in your browser.

## Running the App
The app runs in the browser after being executed in the Jupyter notebook. Use the following steps:
1. Enter Python code in the left textbox.
2. Click the **Convert Code** button to generate the C++ equivalent.
3. Use the **Run Python Code** or **Run C++ Code** buttons to execute the respective code.
4. The results or any errors will appear in the designated result boxes.

## Security Disclaimer
This app allows executing arbitrary Python and C++ code, which can be dangerous. **Do not deploy this app** in environments where malicious users might have access. This project is purely for personal learning and exploration purposes.

---

## Motivation
This project was created as a mini experiment to explore the functionalities of Gradio and to play around with Python-to-C++ code conversion and execution. It's not a production-ready tool but rather a fun way to learn about interactive UIs and code execution workflows.
